I had the opportunity to participate in the IBM Hack Challenge, where I developed a dynamic dashboard using IBM tools. The project involved leveraging advanced features of IBM's ecosystem to create a user-friendly interface with robust data visualization capabilities. The dashboard visualized data on 100 K-dramas, including their ranking positions, total duration in hours, number of episodes, main roles played, and their popularity by title. By analyzing this data, the dashboard helped identify the most popular dramas viewed. This experience not only allowed me to enhance my technical skills in data visualization but also provided valuable insights into solving real-world problems through innovative design, teamwork, and using data-driven decision-making.
